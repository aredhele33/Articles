### What is the purpose of this project ?

This project provides sources to illustrate an article on https://vincentcalisto.com/

### What can I find in this project ?

A very simple implementation of a stack allocator to show how it works. You will find :

* StackAllocatorGeneric to allocate raw buffers of arbitrary sizes;
* StackAllocatorSpecialized to pool objects of a specified type.

Keep in mind that it can be used as-is but, for a real applications, you might want to
modify / extend it.

### What is a stack allocator in a few words ?
<div style="text-align: justify">
In the allocator family, a stack allocator is a kind of memory allocator that performs 
"stacked" allocations in a contiguous memory buffer with some constraints.
This is a specialized allocator, so it is not suitable for all allocation patterns.
However, since it is extremely simple, it is also extremely efficient when suitable.
